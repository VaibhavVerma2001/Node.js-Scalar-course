// Global objects in Node.js are objects that are available to all modules in a Node.js application. They are created when the Node.js runtime starts up and can be accessed using the global keyword.In a web browser, the global object is the window object.


// console.log(window); -> window is there only in browser, not is node.js
// console.log(global); // in node.js , there is global

let name = "vaibhav";
// in browser 
// console.log(window.name); //  will print "vaibhav"
console.log(global.name);

// but in node.js -> global.name will print undefined -> because in node.js it is limited to this file only
// bec if there is let name = "ayush" in some other file then it will be overwritten if it is global thats why in node.js all files are seperate and this is called as module



// import module
